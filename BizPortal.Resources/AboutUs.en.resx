    Microsoft ResX Schema 
    
    Version 2.0
    
    The primary goals of this format is to allow a simple XML format 
    that is mostly human readable. The generation and parsing of the 
    various data types are done through the TypeConverter classes 
    associated with the data types.
    
    Example:
    
    ... ado.net/XML headers & schema ...
    <resheader name="resmimetype">text/microsoft-resx</resheader>
    <resheader name="version">2.0</resheader>
    <resheader name="reader">System.Resources.ResXResourceReader, System.Windows.Forms, ...</resheader>
    <resheader name="writer">System.Resources.ResXResourceWriter, System.Windows.Forms, ...</resheader>
    <data name="Name1"><value>this is my long string</value><comment>this is a comment</comment></data>
    <data name="Color1" type="System.Drawing.Color, System.Drawing">Blue</data>
    <data name="Bitmap1" mimetype="application/x-microsoft.net.object.binary.base64">
        <value>[base64 mime encoded serialized .NET Framework object]</value>
    </data>
    <data name="Icon1" type="System.Drawing.Icon, System.Drawing" mimetype="application/x-microsoft.net.object.bytearray.base64">
        <value>[base64 mime encoded string representing a byte array form of the .NET Framework object]</value>
        <comment>This is a comment</comment>
    </data>
                
    There are any number of "resheader" rows that contain simple 
    name/value pairs.
    
    Each data row contains a name, and value. The row also contains a 
    type or mimetype. Type corresponds to a .NET class that support 
    text/value conversion through the TypeConverter architecture. 
    Classes that don't support this are serialized and stored with the 
    mimetype set.
    
    The mimetype is used for serialized objects, and tells the 
    ResXResourceReader how to depersist the object. This is currently not 
    extensible. For a given mimetype the value must be set accordingly:
    
    Note - application/x-microsoft.net.object.binary.base64 is the format 
    that the ResXResourceWriter will generate, however the reader can 
    read any of the formats listed below.
    
    mimetype: application/x-microsoft.net.object.binary.base64
    value   : The object must be serialized with 
            : System.Runtime.Serialization.Formatters.Binary.BinaryFormatter
            : and then encoded with base64 encoding.
    
    mimetype: application/x-microsoft.net.object.soap.base64
    value   : The object must be serialized with 
            : System.Runtime.Serialization.Formatters.Soap.SoapFormatter
            : and then encoded with base64 encoding.

    mimetype: application/x-microsoft.net.object.bytearray.base64
    value   : The object must be serialized into a byte array 
            : using a System.ComponentModel.TypeConverter
            : and then encoded with base64 encoding.

    <value>&lt;p&gt;From the current situation, Thailand is facing with many challenges around. The challenges have been occurred very fast and dynamic. The intense competition and the coherence of the global economy stimulate the improvement in both public and private sectors in order to face with the current challenges and the new trends. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the dimensions of the public sector as a supporter, regulator and policymakers, it is important to develop efficiency in providing services to facilitate the investors and the public in order to make an attractive environment to attract the investment from outside to create economic stability and enhancing competitiveness of the country. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Improving of Government Service to be e-Government is important process that many countries have been used to enhance the governmental services to experience the successes.  It has been proven that e-Government could encourage the countries to meet the higher capacities and greater investments. Countries that are ranked in ease of doing business and high levels of world competitiveness are the same countries that have the high capability of e-Government. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although, Thailand’s public agency has been developed e-Government system for a while but the governmental services are still not fully integrated. Due to this problem, there is the burden for the private sector and the public to receive the services from government agencies which is affected Thailand’s competitiveness to reach the lower level than other ASEAN countries. From this problem, Thailand’ public agency need to be improved the e-Government in order to lift Thailand’s competitiveness and aggregate FDI inflow. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to ease of doing business report by World Bank, which reveals procedure, time, cost as well as law and regulations of public service in the sense of efficiency and quality on supporting or distracting the business operation, In 2016, Thailand’ competitiveness was ranked No. 49 from 189 countries. Thailand’s 2016 ranking was decreased comparing with the ranking of 2015. Thus, Thailand needs to improve the governmental services for enhancing FDI. These improvements are included improving the service quality and developing the current services to meet the success and could reach the improvements of other countries. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Starting Business which is one of ease of doing business index is in the procedures of starting business. In 2016 Thailand stands at 96 in the ranking of 189 global economic zones. Department of Business Development, the Revenue Department, and Social Security Office have developed data link of e – starting business and operated single point at Department of Business Development since 2010. The Thai government plans on enhancing public services for starting business more efficiency as well as integrates governmental services on complete electronic system in 2016. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Therefore, main organizations related to starting business, for example, Department of Business Development, Social Security Office, and Department of Labour Protection and Welfare have developed, together with Office of Public Sector Development Committee and Electronic Government Agency (Public Organization) have developed Biz Portal in order to establish the central system of starting business. Entrepreneurs and investors are able to contact to start up business by applying online, filling in forms, submitting documents through computer any time and any place. This online service is available from 29 February 2016. The applicants could submit for business registration at Department of Business Development. Then, applicants will receive password for logging in Biz Portal in order to apply for registration of employers, registration of insurers or work regulations through the system. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the future Biz Portal system will be developed to fully provide the services by linking other aspects of starting business as dealing with construction permits and getting electricity which could facilitate the entrepreneurs to receive faster and more comfortable services as well as lower the operation cost. It is expected that Biz Portal system would assist increasing ease of doing business ranking of Thailand next year. This higher ranking would help attracting the investors to invest in Thailand which could lead to higher employment, higher income as well as Thailand’s macroeconomic. &lt;/p&gt;</value>
